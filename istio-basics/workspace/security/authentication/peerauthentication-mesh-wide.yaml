# To prevent non-mutual TLS traffic for the whole mesh, set a mesh-wide peer authentication policy with the mutual TLS mode set to STRICT. This priactice (meshwide) is common in enterprises.

# The mesh-wide peer authentication policy should not have a selector and must be applied in the root namespace (see below).
# This peer authentication policy configures workloads to only accept requests encrypted with TLS. Since it doesnâ€™t specify a value for the selector field, the policy applies to all workloads in the mesh.
