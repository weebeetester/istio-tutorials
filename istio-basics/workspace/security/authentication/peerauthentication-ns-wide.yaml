# To change mutual TLS for all workloads within a particular namespace, use a namespace-wide policy.
# The specification of the policy is the same as for a mesh-wide policy, but you specify the namespace it applies to under metadata.
# Again, since it doesnâ€™t specify a value for the selector field, the policy applies to all workloads in the namespace.

# A workload-specific peer authentication policy takes precedence over a namespace-wide policy.
