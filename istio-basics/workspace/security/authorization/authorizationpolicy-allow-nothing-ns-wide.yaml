# Below policy creates an allow-nothing policy in the default namespace. 
# The policy doesnâ€™t have a selector field, which applies the policy to every workload in the default namespace. 
# The spec: field of the policy has the empty value {}. That value means that no traffic is permitted, effectively denying all requests.
